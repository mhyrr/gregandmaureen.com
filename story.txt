For some of you who don't know how Greg and Maureen met, here's our story. Maureen had moved back to Silver Spring after college and was hanging out with one of her highschool friends who also happened to be friends with Greg. A few times their paths had crossed but no sparks had flown until one exciting night two years after meeting for the first time.  The very next night Greg couldn't wait and got enough courage to ask Maureen on their first date. A few days later, we met for dinner at a very small restaurant in Silver Spring. It's a funny thing, but before the date even started, Maureen had sent their neutral friend a text, or so she thought, saying how excited she was to go on her date with Greg. The text went to Greg instead and she had no idea until after their date of her mishap. The whole time, Greg was walking on air and hasn't ever been nervous since then.
